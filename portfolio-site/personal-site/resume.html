          <h3>A Tribute To Toriyama</h3>
          <p>This video was dedicated to Akira Toriyama, who became one of my main inspirations for pursuing a professional career in art. Though he may have passed, the spirit of his work lives on in all who were motivated to become artists thanks to his legacy; gone, but not forgotten.</p>

          <h3>Laser Gun Concept</h3>
          <p>This pixel art was originally designed to be incorporated into a video game that some friends and I were collaborating on. While the main premise of the game is a dating sim, there are also enemies you have to defeat while exploring via platforming.</p>
