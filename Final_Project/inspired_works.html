    <section id="inspiration-5"><h2>1. Hybrid Dragon #1</h2><ul>
        <img src="images/hybrid-dragon.png">
        <li>Hybrid of 2 dragon species from the "Wings of Fire" series</li>
        <li>Based off of my first film inspiration of "How To Train Your Dragon" (HTTYD)</li>
        <li>Reflects my interest in dragons, and the world of fantasy in general thanks to HTTYD</li>
      </ul></section>

    <section id="inspiration-6"><h2>2. Halloween Animation</h2><ul>
        <img src="images/halloween.png">
        <br><a href="https://youtu.be/9VUNysTbl7Q">Link To "Halloween Animation"</a></br>
        <li>Related to the Halloween/ghost theme in "Ghostbusters"</li>
        <li>I was born in the same month as Halloween, so it's one of my favorite holidays and I wanted to do something for it</li>
        <li>This was the first time I had touched digital tools to make art, and it was a fun experience to make this</li>
    </ul></section>
  
    <section id="inspiration-7"><h2>3. Monster Of The Deep</h2><ul>
        <img src="images/monster.png">
        <br><a href="https://youtu.be/l_CRTkDEbnY">Link To "Monster Of The Deep"</a></br>
        <li>This was one of my first times using Adobe After Effects</li>
        <li>I wanted to experiment with glow, color change, variations of movement, and more</li>
        <li>The idea of making an short video about Godzilla appearing, then diving under the waves, seemed to fit best</li>
    </ul></section>
  
    <section id="inspiration-8"><h2>4. A Tribute To Toriyama</h2><ul>
        <img src="images/tribute.png">
        <br><a href="https://youtu.be/6RKTYGEYpEg">Link To "A Tribute To Toriyama"</a></br>
        <li>I hadn't drawn anything digital in a while, so I wanted to see how much I'd improved</li>
        <li>This was during the time of Akira Toriyama's passing, so I wanted to make something that pays homage to him</li>
        <li>I like "Dragon Ball", so I decided to do a self-portrait in his art style</li>
    </ul></section>
